    <h2>Your Estimated Carbon Emission</h2>
    <p><strong>{{ carbon }} kg CO2 per day</strong></p>

    <hr>

    <h3>How It Was Calculated</h3>
    <p>
        Your daily carbon footprint is estimated based on the information you provided:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Daily Travel:</strong> Your daily travel distance and choice of transportation (car, bus, bike, etc.) contribute to CO₂ emissions.</li>
        <li><strong>Energy Usage:</strong> The electricity or energy you consume at home, measured in kWh, adds to your carbon footprint.</li>
        <li><strong>Diet Type:</strong> Food choices have a significant impact. For example, omnivorous diets typically have higher CO₂ emissions compared to vegetarian or vegan diets.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Insights</h3>
    <p>
        Based on your estimated carbon emission:
    </p>
    {% if carbon < 5 %}
        <p class="good">✅ Great! Your daily carbon footprint is low. Keep up these sustainable habits.</p>
    {% elif carbon < 10 %}
        <p class="moderate">⚠️ Moderate. Your carbon footprint is average. Consider reducing car usage, conserving energy, or adopting a plant-based diet to improve sustainability.</p>
    {% else %}
        <p class="high">❌ High. Your daily carbon emission is above average. Try eco-friendly transportation, energy-saving practices, and a more plant-based diet to reduce your impact.</p>
    {% endif %}
